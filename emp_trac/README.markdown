# Wave Software Development Challenge - Rad Wojcik

Please review my submission. In my case, I kept it pretty simple and clean. I kept the front-end vanilla. I would
figure out the clients UX requirements at a later time. Since there were no functional requirements for UX I left it
without any customization. I would like to show case this as a strength, following exact direction, no more no less.The requirements that were gathered, were written in a very logical and clean manner while keeping it simple. The choice was mde to create a 1-1 relationship between employee and user. The project was split into two apps, employees and expenses, which might scale better as the code grows. I am proud of the fact that I could turn over my code to another developer, and they wouldn't have any problems figuring it out quickly.
