# Sarah's Wave Challenge Solution

#Setup
1. Make sure you have python installed
1. Make sure you have django installed (pip install django), preferably in a virtual environment
1. From the directory expenses/ run the command python manage.py migrate - this will set up your local database.

#Using the app
1. Navigate to expenses/ and run the command python manage.py runserver
1. On your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Upload your file and click submit
3. You'll see your results on the page.. :)

#What I'm proud of
1. I think the models work well together, they make sense, and you can search by file in case you'd like to do queries on previous files uploaded.
