    - Almost nothing got done
    - Basic testing for url routing, and basic plumbing for views complete...not much else
    - Need to find a quiet spot
    - Where you left off: getting the right template loaded for the expense report detail view

    - Aiming to complete all other aspects of the coding challenge Including:
        - Persistent .csv storage
        - Storage of associated .csv data
        - Testing suite
        - Drag and drop interface?
        - Wave theming?
    - Running out of time...maybe cut back on the testing or at least be less rigorous
    - Why won't the decimal type conversion work?
        - an hour and a half later...still no type conversion
        - Commas are the devil...always make sure your strings are PROPERLY FORMATTED!
        - Wondering if a test would've helped me here...
    - Drag and Drop interface is a no go...no time left
    - Basic styling complete...tried to emulate the wave look. Ran out of time.
    - No feedback if form upload fails :S
