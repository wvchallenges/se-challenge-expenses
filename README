Particularly proud of:
    I'm not particularly proud of anything to be honest, because
    everything done here was done many times before by many people,
    and it is trivial implenenation at best. However, what I would be proud of 
    is the process of developing this project.

    I took this code challenge as a personal challenge to keep the google
    search (or stackoverflow search) to a minimum. Having PHP as my current
    dayjob, I ended up searching 7 times total. I think that is pretty neat.

    I guess it would be worht mentioning that I built a simple api,
    and I seperated model to Employee, Expense and Category envisioning that
    that was a wise move to make.
