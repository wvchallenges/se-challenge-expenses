# Tsering's CVS Migration Project

This is my submission for the Wave Coding Challenge.

I'm glad to be able to showcase my Django skills by building this small web app.

Given the time constraints, I wasn't able to make it as pretty or as functional as I'd like, but I think this is a good example of my skills.

Here are a few reasons I feel this was a good exercise:

1. I got to use the `csv` module to parse the CSV file
2. The need for uploading a file got me thinking of using AJAX to display a progress bar
3. The complexity of the CSV dataset justified building multiple models and ForeignKeys
4. I got to use the `collections` module to help store and organize my data
5. I got to use the Django ORM to run queries
6. I got to use the `datetime` module to convert strings to datetime objects

At the bottom of my README, I've documented some additional ideas to enhance this project.

### Installation

Create a virtualenv

    $ virtualenv /opt/cvs_migration_project_env

Download the latest code from Github and install the requirements.

    $ source /opt/cvs_migration_project_env ; cd /opt/cvs_migration_project_env
    $ git clone -b develop https://github.com/tpaljor/se-challenge
    $ pip install -r se-challenge/requirements.txt

Initialize the database and start the development server

    $ cd se-challenge/csv_migration_project/
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver

You should now be able to see the site at http://localhost:8000

### Ideas to enhance this project

1. Move some of the business logic in a separate file
2. Write functional tests and unit tests
3. Add user registration and login
4. Save each upload event and have it viewable by the user
