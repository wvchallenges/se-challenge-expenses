# Wave Software Development Challenge

## Assumptions
The solution to the challenge makes the following assumptions in addition to
the ones given in the challenge description:
* Employees in the files can be uniquely identified by their name and address
combination.

## Software Requirements
The application was developed and designed with the following software
versions on Ubuntu 14.04:
* Python 2.7
* PostgreSQL 9.3

On Ubuntu, run the following command to install the required software:
```
sudo apt-get install python postgresql
```

Refer to [this guide](https://techarena51.com/index.php/flask-sqlalchemy-postgresql-tutorial/)
to set up a PostgreSQL user, password, and database.

## Set-up
Ensure that the software in the Software Requirements are installed for your
operating system. Perform the following inside the `se-challenge` directory.
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Modify line 28 in `app.py` with your user, pasword and database.
```
33. app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost/<database>'
```
3. Run the `python` interpreter from command line. We need to create the tables
for the application.
4. In the Python interpreter, type the following:
```
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> quit()
```
The application is now ready.

## Running
Run the following from inside the `se-challenge` directory
1. `export FLASK_APP=app.py`
2. `flask run`
Optionally, run `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` to run with debugger on.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/` to view the application.
