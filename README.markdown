# Wave Software Development Challenge
I used PHP + MySQL to complete this challenge since I consider this pair as the easiest way to test and distribute solution.

## Instructions
### Prerequisites
To run this example you should have an environment with PHP 5, MySQL 5.5 or above and any web server.

### Installation
1. Please copy index.php file to the folder on a web server and make sure it is accessible through http.
1. Change $username, $password and $hostname variables in file (please note that user should have permissions to create databases on MySQL instance).

### Run application
1. Open web browser (tested in IE10 and Chrome 46.0.2490.80) and type URL of a folder with index.php file.
1. By default application will show you previously uploaded data, to overwrite it please choose a csv file and click "Import data" button.

Alternatively you may test it on my [development environment] (http://144.76.250.174/wave)

## Points of interest
The solution itself takes less that 50 rows of code and easy to distribute, it does not require any additional database configuration efforts and simple to use. I use this approach to automate my day-to-day tasks and save time. I've wrote hundreds of such scripts using different programming languages from PowerShell to JavaScript (I know 8 programming lamguages) to automate user activities. I'm passioned to the philosofy of "Do not do what machine does" so I believe that I am a good fit for Software Engineering Manager position and can bring value to your company.

Thank you for your time and this test, I really enjoyed 72.5 minutes spent on it =)
