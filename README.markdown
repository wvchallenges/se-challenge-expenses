# Wave Software Development Challenge

Hi! I'm Nilesh. This project done in Ruby on Rails took me a total of about 2.5 hours. 

A couple of notes:

1. For task #4 where we had to show the expenses per month based on the uploaded file - I added an extra column in the Expenses table for the total tax amount, which gets updated as you upload a new csv file. This (slightly) reduces the time it takes to calculate the total expenses per month.
1. Instead of naming the tables something like "new data", I thought it would make more sense to name it "expenses".
1. In the same way, the notes asked to update monthly expenses per uploaded file, but I thought it would be more useful to show the total expenses per month. 
1. I'd like to think the code is neat and follows rails conventions!
