#Roberts Wave test

##Introduction

Hello my name is Rob McMahon and this is my implementation for the Wave test. I very much enjoyed this test the data presented interesting challenges during parsing that were fun to solve. I developed my solution inside a stripped down version of my home development environment. It uses Django Rest Framework as an API backend and Django as an application backend. The front end is very minimal and uses bootstrap for UI and knockout.js for some interactivity. The development environment runs on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS vm and is provisioned using ansible. The ansible playbook has many tags to allow syncing without backend service restart or even complete database redeployment in a single call. I hope you enjoy reading my solution as much as I have enjoyed building it.

## Deployment instructions

This project was build to run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and setup will be very minimal. Using the vm provider of your choice create an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS VM. Once the vm is created follow these steps

1. Forward port 80 to this VM if using NAT networking
2. On this vm create a sudo privileged user called wave-admin. 
3. apt-get update and upgrade your new server
4. git clone this project into wave-admins home directory 
5. cd into the cloned repo
6. run sudo sh setup.sh

## Points of persional pride

This application presented a lot of interesting problems to solve. I started by looking at the data presented in the CSV and designed a scalable structure to hold not only the expense data but the normalized employee and address data as well. I am rather proud of the efficiency and functionality of my API backend. I used a custom view to pre process the data into a format more acceptable the django rest framework list serializes. I aimed for generic maintainable code wherever possible and focused on efficient database interaction. I also overrode the serializer create functions to return an instance in certain conditions. This prevents employees or address being duplicated and does not require some custom long winded validation. 




#The project 


# Wave Software Development Challenge
Applicants for the [Software developer](https://wave.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=1) role at Wave must complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the onsite interview. 

The purpose of this exercise is to create something that we can work on together during the onsite. We do this so that you get a chance to collaborate with Wavers during the interview in a situation where you know something better than us (it's your code, after all!) 

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the onsite interview.

Please use whatever programming language and framework you feel the most comfortable with.

Feel free to email [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com) if you have any questions.

## Project Description
Imagine that Wave has just acquired a new company. Unfortunately, the company has never stored their data in a database, and instead uses a comma separated text file. We need to create a way for the new subsidiary to import their data into a database. Your task is to create a web interface that accepts file uploads, and then stores them in a relational database.

### What your web-based application must do:

1. Your app must accept (via a form) a comma separated file with the following columns: date, category, employee name, employee address, expense description, pre-tax amount, tax name, and tax amount.
1. You can make the following assumptions:
 1. Columns will always be in that order.
 2. There will always be data in each column.
 3. There will always be a header line.

 An example input file named `data_example.csv` is included in this repo.

1. Your app must parse the given file, and store the information in a relational database.
1. After upload, your application should display a table of the total expenses amount per-month represented by the uploaded file.

Your application should be easy to set up, and should run on either Linux or Mac OS X. It should not require any non open-source software.

There are many ways that this application could be built; we ask that you build it in a way that showcases one of your strengths. If you you enjoy front-end development, do something interesting with the interface. If you like object-oriented design, feel free to dive deeper into the domain model of this problem. We're happy to tweak the requirements slightly if it helps you show off one of your strengths.

### Documentation:

Please modify `README.md` to add:

1. Instructions on how to build/run your application
1. A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why.

## Submission Instructions

1. Fork this project on github. You will need to create an account if you don't already have one.
1. Complete the project as described below within your fork.
1. Push all of your changes to your fork on github and submit a pull request. 
1. You should also email [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com) and your recruiter to let them know you have submitted a solution. Make sure to include your github username in your email (so we can match applicants with pull requests.)

## Alternate Submission Instructions (if you don't want to publicize completing the challenge)
1. Clone the repository.
1. Complete your project as described below within your local repository.
1. Email a patch file to [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com)

## Evaluation
Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. 

1. Did you follow the instructions for submission? 
1. Did you document your build/deploy instructions and your explanation of what you did well?
1. Were models/entities and other components easily identifiable to the reviewer? 
1. What design decisions did you make when designing your models/entities? Why (i.e. were they explained?)
1. Did you separate any concerns in your application? Why or why not?
1. Does your solution use appropriate datatypes for the problem as described?
