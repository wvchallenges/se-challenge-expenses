# Wave Software Development Challenge

Proud of scaffolding a new django project with really simple setup using virtual environment. Initially I was making it complicated by using docker, but eventually realized that for testing purposes I can just use virtualenv which comes bundled with python 3.

One improvement would be to write some tests. Also CSVHandle class in utils.py is crude, next step would be to improve that.
