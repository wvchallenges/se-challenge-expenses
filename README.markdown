## Project Statement

I am proud that despite the relatively short time recommended be spent, (a couple of hours), I learned enough about how csv imports and how dates work within Rails to successfully clean and import the data as appropriate. I am convinced that with a little bit of guidance, I'd have figured out how to correctly group expenses by month and by date using ActiveRecord. I am pleased that I enjoyed this challenge. I got as far as:  @monthly_expenses = Expense.all.group_by { |e| e.date.month } 

I am pleased with how I commented the code and let things be well readable. I'm also pleased that I created skinny views and controllers.

Look forward to chatting about the possibility of a current or future fit with wave.
