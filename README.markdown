# Wave Software Development Challenge
### Documentation:
To run this you can either open up an IDE open the wavechallenge.py and then run it or in the terminal 'python wavechallenge.py' will work too.The data_example.csv must be in the same directory as the wavechallenge.py and SQLite3 shell must be running.

One of my goals while doing this challenge was not to use any external frameworks to complete this challenge.I felt that python provided all tools/libraries needed to complete this challenge.Furthermore using objects to do this challenge would have been more tideous as the requirements are relatively straight forward and can be done easily without OOP.

##Note:
This will not work with python 3 as there are different imports required.


### Dependencies:

- Python 2.7 (Comes default in Mac OSX and Linux , install python 2.7 on Windows https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- SQLite3
