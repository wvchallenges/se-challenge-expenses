Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my submission for the SeChallenge.

I decided to write the solution in Ruby/Rails, as I currently work with Ruby in my workplace, and am more familiar
with it that Python. 

My proudest factor with this challenge was that despite being my first time trying Rails, I was able to (eventually) figure out how to work with it and get a working solution. In terms of actual implementation, I tried to focus on learning what are good practices with the MVC methodology and REST API in Rails, in terms of laying things out. I then tried to separate out logical pieces of business logic (CsvHelper, month_totals in Expense) to go for the "Ravioli" coding practice. This is so that any future pieces that require the same logic can reuse it easily. Not to mention the testability that this brought; I wrote two tests for converting the csv, then getting the month totals.

What I didn't focus on for this challenge was the front-end visualization. I thought it was more important to get the foundation in place.
I must admit, I am not an expert in Ruby/Rails, nor with web development in general. However, I am confident in the following things:
 - ability to learn things very quickly
 - always striving to do things the "right" way
 - architecting design on system level
 - passion and drive to get things done
These personal qualities have proved me to be successful in my current/past positions. I hope to speak with you sometime soon!
