# Wave Software Development Challenge
Applicants for the [Software developer](https://wave.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=1) role at Wave must complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the onsite interview. 

The purpose of this exercise is to create something that we can work on together during the onsite. We do this so that you get a chance to collaborate with Wavers during the interview in a situation where you know something better than us (it's your code, after all!) 

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the onsite interview.

Please use whatever programming language and framework you feel the most comfortable with.

Feel free to email [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com) if you have any questions.

## Project Description
Imagine that Wave has just acquired a new company. Unfortunately, the company has never stored their data in a database, and instead uses a comma separated text file. We need to create a way for the new subsidiary to import their data into a database. Your task is to create a web interface that accepts file uploads, and then stores them in a relational database.

### What your web-based application must do:

1. Your app must accept (via a form) a comma separated file with the following columns: date, category, employee name, employee address, expense description, pre-tax amount, tax name, and tax amount.
1. You can make the following assumptions:
 1. Columns will always be in that order.
 2. There will always be data in each column.
 3. There will always be a header line.

 An example input file named `data_example.csv` is included in this repo.

1. Your app must parse the given file, and store the information in a relational database.
1. After upload, your application should display a table of the total expenses amount per-month represented by the uploaded file.

Your application should be easy to set up, and should run on either Linux or Mac OS X. It should not require any non open-source software.

There are many ways that this application could be built; we ask that you build it in a way that showcases one of your strengths. If you you enjoy front-end development, do something interesting with the interface. If you like object-oriented design, feel free to dive deeper into the domain model of this problem. We're happy to tweak the requirements slightly if it helps you show off one of your strengths.

## Documentation:

### Scope and Implementation
The challenge has been completed. The implementation was done in Java/Spring Boot. The packaging tool is maven. Below will be a detail description on how to build and brign up the server. The given criterias where completed to best of my knowledge and limited time. I have also add a basic navie security module to project, which can be extended in the future. The current implementation extendable and can be extended to different type of data file. 
This project will require a DB, the data base used was MYSQL.
### Build & Executed
After cloneing the repo. change the directory to expenseeeport
```$ mkdir expenseeport```

Start a MY SQLDB image using docker. 
```$ docker run -d --name sech-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=test -e MYSQL_USER=dbuser    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass mysql:latest```

After the DB is up clean an install the package by running the below command.
linux/OSX : ```$ ./mvnw clean install```
windows: ```$ mvnw.bat clean install```

Start the applicationby running the below command.

linux/OSX : ```$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run```
windowsa: ```$ mvnw.bat spring-boot:run```
