# Wave Software Development Challenge

## Intro

**Technology**

While choosing a set of technologies for this challenge I had two goals in mind:

1. Using languages, software, and operating systems I have used in the past so
  that I can get to a working solution fast and best showcase my skills.
1. Still picking some new tools/libraries for 1-2 thing as this challenge is a
  perfect opportunity to better myself and explore new things in a safe environment.

**Goals**

The problem at hand is very simplistic but, can be interpreted in a myriad of
ways. Hence the problem here is now ticking the requirement but showing some
depth in the mastery of an aspect of web development you are comfortable with.

A second goal should be thinking about the user, this is what Wave, and many
other great organizations do: start from the user. What is the user trying to
accomplish? How can we make it as easy as possible? How can we delight the
user? Often the answer is by doing your very best in each aspect Design /
Experience / User Interface / Performance / Stability / Iteration Speed /
Innovation.

Third, thinking of the onsite interview, how can we make sure this project
includes grounds for interesting discussions. How can we make it technically
interesting and easy to change/update/modify.

## Development

### Technical stack

TODO

### Building

TODO Talk about dependencies and follow with building instructions.

### Testing

TODO Discuss kinds of testing involved (unit, integration, system) and libraries used, touch on how
actually run these.

## Production

TODO Overview of what's discussed in this section and how some subject where simplified for the
exercise but could be expanded upon.

### Deploying changes

TODO Talk about `scripts/deploy.sh` and it could be scaled/automated in production using some custom
software or Ansible/Chef/Puppet/SaltStack. Touch on database migrations.

### Provisioning new servers

TODO Talk about host choice, server distro, `scripts/provision.sh`, touch on run manually in this
case but can be automated with Ansible/Tower | Chef/Server | Puppet/Server.

### Understanding day-to-day operations

**Server**

**Application process**

**Database**

**Logging**

**Performance monitoring**

**User monitoring**

**Security**

**Disaster recovery**
