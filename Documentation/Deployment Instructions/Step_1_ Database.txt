The instructions are for installing the application and database on the same Windows machine.
I have tested these on Windows 10 with IIS 10. 

For the database I have chosen PostgreSQL, since it is free, well supported and relational.
Audience expectations: some experience with administering PostgreSql

Installation Instructions:

1) Install PostgreSQL 9.5.4.
 - Name admin account "postgres"
 - Set admin account passowrd to "WaveAdmin123$"
2) Open pgAdmin
3) Create new login role, name it "AccountingDbUser".
 - Set the password to "WorkGreat1!"
3) Create new database, name it "AccountingDb" and make "AccountingDbUser" an owner.

	CREATE DATABASE "AccountingDb"
	  WITH ENCODING='UTF8'
	       OWNER="AccountingDbUser"
	       CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;

4) Create "EmployeeExpense" table with the following script:

CREATE TABLE public."EmployeeExpense"
(
   "Date" date NOT NULL, 
   "Category" character varying(128) NOT NULL, 
   "EmployeeName" character varying(128) NOT NULL, 
   "EmployeeAddress" character varying(256) NOT NULL, 
   "ExpenseDescription" character varying(128) NOT NULL, 
   "PreTaxAmount" numeric(16,2) NOT NULL, 
   "TaxName" character varying(64) NOT NULL, 
   "TaxAmount" numeric(16,2) NOT NULL, 
   "Id" serial NOT NULL, 
   CONSTRAINT "PK_EmployeeExpense" PRIMARY KEY ("Id")
) 
WITH (
  OIDS = FALSE
)
;

5) Done.
