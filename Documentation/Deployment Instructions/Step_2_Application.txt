Below are the instructions for deploying it to your own IIS server.
I have tested these on Windows 10 with IIS 10. 

Part I. Create Deployment package
1) Open solution in Visual Studio 2015 (Community or higher)
2) In "Solution Explorer", right-click on the "Wave Challenge" project, click on "Publish". "Publish Web" window will pop up.
3) Select "Demo" profile. Click Next
4) In "Package location" field, enter the path to where you want the deployment package to be saved, as long as the package name.
For example "C:\Wave\wave_app.zip"
5) Click "Publish". Package is ready.

Part II. Create a website in IIS
1) Open IIS
2) In the "Connections" pane, expand your server.
3) Right-click on "Sites" -> Add Website
4) Set site name to "WaveChallenge"
5) Set Physical path to the one where you want the application to be installed in.
6) Set host name to localhost. Click Add


Part III. Import Deployment Package to IIS
-- I assume your IIS is configured for ASP.NET applications
1) In IIS, navigate to "WaveChallenge" website
2) In the Actions pane, under Deploy section, click on "Import Application...". 
Note: if there is no "Deploy" section there, install Web Deploy 3.5 and Web Deployment Tool 2.1 from Web Platform Installer. Re-open IIS.
3) Select the Deployment Package that we created in Part I. Hit "Open"
4) Proceed with "Next" all the way and click "Finish" at the end.

Part IV. Test
1) While in IIS, navigate to "ChallengeApp" under "WaveChallenge" website.
2) In the Action pane -> Manage Application -> Browse Website section click on "Browse localhost on *:80 (http)" link.
3) Test the application.
